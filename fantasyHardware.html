 <p >When the RTX 3070 was announced, its outstanding price to performance ratio led many people to ditch, and sell their old cards, and buy Nvidia’s exceptionally performing card  However, the 3070 sold out in a matter of seconds, leading many people to believe it a paper launch. This served as a major disappointment to many people, hoping to upgrade after a long wait since the release of the 20 series cards. Furthermore, the RTX 3090, and RX 6900xt were released, upon which the same occurrence of little stock, and extreme demand was prevalent. This isn’t surprising, as these cards launched at a similar time to the Xbox Series X, and the PlayStation 5, at around Christmas: a shortage in supply of chips was bound to happen.  </p>

<h2> So, what caused this to happen? </h2>

<p> Both Nvidia and AMD rely on silicon wafers produced by other companies, which include Samsung and TSMC. The issue is that they are not only ones that do so: mobile APUs, laptops, desktops, television, and even cars, all rely on silicon wafers, and other chip components, produced by only a few companies. The cost of raw materials has also increased drastically. It’s not hard to imagine that a global pandemic, causing a major shortage in supply, would be enough to create a global chip shortage, decreasing the supply in GPUs.
It goes further than GPUs
The global chip shortage has proved to be a major inconvenience for many other markets, notably the automotive industry, in which was also heavily affected by the drastic increase in the cost of raw materials. Recently, Ford and General Motors are making a deal with the chipmaker GlobalFoundries, in an effort to tackle the chip shortage. It seems like eventually, the automotive industry will find its way eventually, and recover from the pandemic, it is just a matter of time.

    </p>

<h2>Will GPU prices become normal again? </h2>
<p> I doubt GPU prices will ever be “normal” in the sense they before the shortage, although I have reason to believe that there will be an adequate supply in two years, in which deals will be secured, and the GPU market will recover. The demand of GPUs is ever increasing, so a solution will have to be met eventually, even if it means a much higher retail price.</p>
